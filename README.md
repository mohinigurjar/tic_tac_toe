# tic_tac_toe

A simple and fun implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed for two players, taking turns to mark X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, it ends in a draw.
